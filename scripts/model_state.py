model_state.py — one place every number lives, and one way to read it.

The college card was rebuilt around a file like this after the same constants
were found sitting in four scripts, kept in step by remembering to. Nothing
failed when a copy drifted. The run went green and the published page was
simply wrong.

This card had the same defect, in miniature and already live: build_ratings.py
regressed last season's ratings toward the mean with OFF_REGRESS 0.35 and
DEF_REGRESS 0.45 and wrote the result to a Prior2026 column, and nfl_card.py
then IGNORED that column and recomputed the identical number from its own
copy of the constants written as 0.65 and 0.55. Verified against the committed
power_ratings.csv: the two agree to the fourth decimal, which is the rounding
in the CSV. One number, two files, no way to notice a drift.

Every value is also compiled in below. If model_state.json is missing, broken
or truncated the scripts still run on exactly the values they ran on before
this module existed, so a card still gets built. But FELL_BACK is set and the
card reports it, so a silent fallback cannot look like a normal run.

Nothing here imports anything outside the standard library, so it is safe to
import from any of the scripts.
